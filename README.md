# ATC25-RHONE-DATA
Emulating Space Computing Networks with RHONE(ATC'25)
# RHONE Satellite Telemetry Dataset

This repository contains the dataset released in our [USENIX ATC '25](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc25) paper *Emulating Space Computing Networks with RHONE*. The dataset is derived from **Baoyun**, a 12U CubeSat of the **Tiansuan constellation**, which was designed and launched for scientific  research. Baoyun is equipped with widely used **COTS computing payloads**, including **Raspberry Pi 4Bs**, to support experiments in real-time edge computing in space environments.To access and use this dataset, please visit the link here:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-WmbssCbnM2-lAsT6gNB_d0K6ojHJrTm?usp=drive_link

## ðŸ›° Source

The dataset was collected from **real in-orbit telemetry** of Baoyun and spans a period of **123 days**, from **[2022-04-14] to [2022-07-16]**. It primarily consists of **power consumption traces** of various satellite components. These power values are computed from raw electrical telemetryâ€”namely voltage and current readings.

## ðŸ—‚ Data Overview

The dataset is organized into two categories based on the naming convention of the fields:

### Platform Power Data (`p_pl_` prefix)

Includes power traces from  satellite platform subsystems:

- `p_pl_solar1`, `p_pl_solar2`: Power generation from the two solar panels
- `p_total`: Total power generated by the satellite
- `p_sum_bus`: Total power consumed by all onboard systems
- `p_pl_magnetic_torquer`: Power consumption of the magnetic torquer
- `p_pl_xband`: Power usage of the X-band RF communication module
- Other platform subsystems have been anonymized for confidentiality. Their numerical identifiers (e.g., `p_pl_1`) do not reflect physical characteristics and are purely for indexing purposes.

### Payload Power Data (`p_pa_` prefix)

Includes power usage of payloads:

- `p_pa_raspberryPi4b`: Power consumption of the Raspberry Pi 4B payload
- Other payload names have been anonymized for confidentiality. Their numerical identifiers (e.g., `p_pa_03`, `p_pa_12`) do not reflect physical characteristics and are purely for indexing purposes.

## ðŸ“‚ Access and Format

- The dataset is released as CSV files, partitioned by date for ease of use.
